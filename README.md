# FastReader

This is a simple MVP for an app designed for word-by-word reading based on RSVP (Rapid Serial Visual Presentation).

## How to Use it?

- Use the "Left" and "Right" arrows to rewind or fast-forward the text.
- Use the "Up" and "Down" arrows to increase or decrease the reading speed (number of words per second).
- Press the "Space" button to pause/continue the reading.
- You can also adjust the available parameters to customize the experience.

I'll add more information aboute the project soon ;)
